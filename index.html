                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Viljo Wilding. I&apos;m a first year Politics and International Relations student from North London. As someone who is proudly non-binary and bisexual, I&apos;ve experienced many of the struggles faced by LGBT+ people in education, particularly at a state secondary school and sixth form college. COVID-19 has only worsened the mental health problems faced by young LGBT+ people, and our trans and non-binary students struggle to get records to reflect their true name and gender.</p>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>I&apos;m a former SU President, revitalising Woodhouse College&apos;s SU and turning a small union into a campaigning organisation that delivered for students. I was a member of the NUS FE & Soc Cit Zone Committees in 2018-19 and attended NUS conference in 2019 where I supported the Save NUS Trans campaign. Since then, I&apos;ve been working and volunteering in the charity sector. As a Board Member of ADHD Europe, an international non-profit representing people with ADHD, I helped to setup an LGBT+ Committee to understand the experiences of LGBT+ people with ADHD and ensure they are represented in our work.</p>

            <h2>LGBT+ Officer Manifesto</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>I’ll create an LGBT+ welcome pack for students to pick up from the SU with a range of goodies and useful information to stay safe and have fun at uni.</li>
                <li>To support trans and non-binary students, I’ll campaign to make it quicker and easier to change your name and gender on the uni’s IT systems and signpost this information to students.</li>
                <li>I’ll launch a set of resources for LGBT+ students to access important advice, services, and mental health support, and provide answers to common questions about the university experience.</li>
                <li>Working with local businesses and charities, we will start valuable partnerships which support queer organisations and help LGBT+ students access safe and welcoming spaces.</li>
                <li>I’ll collaborate with the wellbeing team and welfare officers to improve training and support for LGBT+ students’ mental health.</li>

            <h2>NUS National &amp; Liberation Conference Delegate</h2>
            <p>
                I’m running to represent you at NUS National & Liberation Conference! As someone who is proudly non-binary and bisexual, I have personal experience of the struggles faced by LGBT+ people in education. Our LGBT+ students deserve to be represented and have these issues dealt with by our national union.<br /><br />
                Elect me, and you’ll have an accountable delegate who will update students regularly and submit a full report. You’ll have a delegate with experience of conference procedure who will ensure UWE students’ voices are heard. Above all else, you’ll have a delegate who will listen to you.
